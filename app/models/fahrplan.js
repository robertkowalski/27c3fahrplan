The entertainment industries go further and further into their crusade against sharing. They not only attack our fundamental freedoms, but also the very essence of the Internet.\n\nThis session is a panorama of the current and upcoming battles, campaigns and actions. Everyone can help defeat the motherf#\u00a7$ers!","description":"The crusade against sharing the entertainment industries are waging against their customers is taking new directions. \n\nTheir obsession to apply models from the past to today's technologies leads these industries to turn copyright against their customers. Direct consequences would be damages to freedom of expression, privacy and the right to a fair trial, that would greatly serve the will of some politicians to control the Internet.\n\nA number of extremely disturbing trends and upcoming legislative projects will be detailed in this session:\n\n- ACTA. The \"Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement\" is the flagship of the entertainment industries. It is a prototype of how to impose legislation while circumventing democratic process and public opinions. ACTA contains most of what the industries are dreaming about. By putting legal and monetary pressure over Internet technical intermediates, ACTA would force them to act as private copyright police and justice of the Net.\n\n- IPRED2. The criminal enforcement directive was frozen in the Council of EU in 2006. It is about to be revived under the direction of the French commissioner Michel Barnier. It may contain sanctions for \"inciting, aiding and abetting\" infringement, which would blur the line between copyright infringement and political speech or the production of software and on-line services.\n\n- \"voluntary agreements\", \"extra-judicial measures\", and \"cooperation between rights-holders and Internet service providers\" sound harmless, but they represent a growing trend in trying to force the ISPs into policing, through contracts, their networks and users. ISPs would be forced to use access restrictions (\"three strikes\") or even content filtering. \n\n- Revision of the e-Commerce directive. The movie and music industries will use this occasion to attack the exoneration of liability for technical intermediates of the Net, with potential consequences on freedom of speech.\n\n- Filtering of the Net. In the name of protecting the children or gamblers, it is being deployed all over Europe. These first steps will allow to further expand filtering mechanisms for the purpose of copyright enforcement, under influence the entertainment industries. \n\nHow those policies are put in place? What can a citizen do in order to help counter them? How can we better organize to gain momentum in protecting fundamental freedoms in the digital environment? What were the successful campaigns so far, and what will be the upcoming ones?\n\nJoin us in our effort!","persons":{"person":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann"},"links":{"link":["La Quadrature du Net","[video] Robocopyright ACTA","La Quadrature's web-dossier on ACTA"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4252"},"start":"14:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":{},"title":"Jahresr\u00fcckblick Internet-Sperren","subtitle":"Eine Zusammenfassung der Ereignisse rund um Zensursurla und Censilia","track":"Society","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"2010 brachte nach den hitzigen Diskussionen um Internet-Sperren und das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz einige nue Entwicklungen.

While crisis mapping carried out via sms and email proved highly successful with the use of Ushahidi in situations like post-election violence in Kenya, tracking crime in Atlanta, or earthquake recovery in Haiti, could it prove useful in such a complex situation as the Afghan political process?  This year a team of people set out to do just that with three different Ushahidi mapping projects for national media, national election observers, and international observers.  The following presentation is about the challenges we faced, successes we did or did not have, and the lessons learned for the future of crisis mapping.","description":"In 2008 an open source mapping system called Ushahidi was put into public use for the first time in history. The occasion was a constitutional referendum in Kenya and the goal of the Ushahidi system was to map and track reports of violence throughout the country in the days following the vote.  Through the use of sms reports from the general public, which were then categorized and published on an interactive map accessible on the internet, anyone anywhere in the world could not only get reports about what was happening, they could get almost real time reports about where violence was happening, when, and details regarding those incidents.  \n\nThe response in Kenya was so large and the attention the site got was so wide spread, Ushahidi would soon be used to map not only violence surrounding an election, but also earthquake recovery, snow storm recovery, forest fire prevention, crime data in urban environments, and elections monitoring. In each of these situations, the power of crowd-sourcing and interactive mapping via simple sms and email technology was all that was needed to get a body of information no media or government organization could compete with.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, on the eve of Parliamentary elections in Afghanistan, several organizations interested in monitoring what happens at the polls and after the votes are in became interested in whether or not Ushahidi could be useful for their purposes. The Afghan Press agency, Pajwhok, as well as the national elections observer organization (FEFA) and the international elections observers (Democracy International) all sought to implement some form of Ushahidi system for their observers. They approached my organization, Small World News (SWN) that has assisted in Ushahidi projects in the past, to carry out this task.\n\nOver the course of just over 1 month, these three systems were rolled out in different ways, with varying level of restrictions due to security and other institutional regulations. The result tells three different stories about how the election went, while also providing a list of lessons about what open source interactive mapping can provide (or not provide) for a nation like Afghanistan with such a specific list of problems.\n\nThe presentation is an explanation of both the process and the lessons learned.","persons":{"0":"\n        "},"links":{"link":["Ushahidi System Built for Internatinal Elections Observers Democracy International","Mapping reports from reporters throughout afghanistan as well as elections monitors.","Free and Fair Elections Afghanistan Map","http:\/\/"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4018"},"start":"23:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 2","slug":{},"title":"FrozenCache","subtitle":"Mitigating cold-boot attacks for Full-Disk-Encryption software","track":"Hacking","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Cold boot attacks are a major risk for the protection that Full-Disk-Encryption solutions provide.

An additional advantage of these virtualization\nsystems is that they can be used to analyze different exploits step by step and\nto extract the exploit code from a running program.\n\nThis talk explains the concept of different attack vectors (stack buffer\noverflows, format string attacks, return to libc attacks, race attacks \/\nTOCTTOU, integer overflows, heap buffer overflows, and code anomalies). For each\nof these attack vectors we show possible exploits and explain how the\nvirtualization system is able to detect and prevent the exploit.","description":"User-space virtualization uses a binary translation framework to instrument all\nrunning code. The instrumentation works like an additional virtualization layer\nand makes it possible to observe any changes to the runtime datastructures (code\nand data) of a running program. We use fastBT to instrument and analyze\ndifferent exploitable programs. The added instrumentation detects changes in\nruntime layout and stops the program whenever exploit code is about to be\nexecuted.\n\nThis talk presents different classes of exploits that can be observed in a\ndynamic instrumentation system. The exploits are analyzed and different security\nstrategies are discussed. We then show how the instrumentation framework can\nimplement an online protection mechanism against each class of attack vectors.\n\nObservable Attack Vectors\n- Stack Overflow\n  A limited buffer is (over) flown with user-data and over writes data on the\n  stack (e.g., the return instruction pointer).\n- Format String Attack\n  An attack can write to an arbitrary address (e.g., the return instruction\n  pointer or the address of a library function) if unvalidated user input is\n  passed directly to the printf function.\n- Return to libc Attack\n  This attack prepares multiple stack frames that execute code sequences in\n  libraries. The stack frame can be constructed so that (almost) arbitrary code\n  is executed.\n- Race Attacks \/ TOCTTOU\n  Time-of-check-to-time-of-use race conditions exploit the fact that they can\n  change values on the stack after they are checked but before they are used in\n  the program or kernel.\n- Integer Overflow\n  Overflows can be triggered by using a negative integer value instead of an\n  unsigned value.\n- Heap Overflow\n  A heap buffer overflow is used to overwrite function pointers or data from the\n  memory allocator to trigger execution of arbitrary code.\n- Code Anomalies\n  x86_64 code is backward compatible to ia32 and in modern operating systems\n  x86_64 and ia32 code can be mixed. The mix of different system calls makes it\n  possible to break out of sand boxes that are not aware of all possible\n  combinations of system calls.\n\nThe exploits are detected generally whenever the program branches to the\ninjected code or to the constructed code fragments. The program is interrupted\nand a debugger can be attached to analyze the state of the program. TOCTTOU\nattacks can be detected by observing the threads and using a specific system\ncall architecture.\n\nConclusion\nDynamic instrumentation is an important tool to prohibit, detect, and analyze\ndifferent attack vectors to running programs. Additional instrumentation guards\ncan be used to better understand exploits.

During the last two years a couple of appliances hit the market which help in finding the \u201cbits of interest\u201d. Recently installed strategies and solutions for carriers, banks or lawful interception organizations will be discussed as examples.","description":"Quite every laptop nowadays is capable of handling Gigabit traffic. But doing a network analysis will hit the boundaries of CPU load quite quickly. Now, with 10GbE lines as the usual speed of carrier's and company's backbone, traffic monitoring and analysis became more and more painful. Even the biggest and most expensive analysis appliances on the market are barely capable of a real time traffic monitoring for more than 8Gbit\/s.\n\nThat's were a couple of vendors showed up and created devices which can handle multiple 10GbE lines at the same time. They call them \u201cActive Distributed Traffic Capture Systems\u201d or \u201cIntelligent Data Access Networking Switches\u201d \u2013 in short \u201cData Access Systems\u201d. The primary use is for the aggregation and distribution of traffic. But all of the Data Access Systems are also capable of filtering traffic with the help of FPGA or CPLD techniques. So a carrier, bank or lawful interception organization can aggregate the data from many physical lines into one Data Access System, enter some filters with the help of a browser GUI, and distribute the resulting traffic to the analysis machines. It's easy to monitor 100 lines of 10GbE traffic.\n\nFor competitive reasons, those vendors started to invent new features for a better or easier analysis of the data on the analysis devices. These include ingress port tagging, time stamping with nanosecond accuracy, slicing of packets and recalculation of checksums in realtime, blanking bits in packets, or even layer 7 filtering for e-mail and instant messenger addresses with full flow capturing.\n\nThe interesting part for the usage is to create an infrastructure where even without data retention and a long term analysis specific users or just their communication with possible \u201dinteresting\u201c data for intelligence agencies can be triggered and captured in real time. So, the process of the analysis can be quickened to quite no time. It's safe to say, that the flagship appliance by a vendor has been designed by request of US intelligence agencies.\n\nOf course, those devices have to be managed by administrators. For the ease of usage every vendor moved from a CLI based configuration interface to a shiny web GUI \u2013 with a couple of flaws. It is easy to break into the system or read out the configuration without access.\n\nThis lecture will discuss the possibilities of today's data analysis with the help of these Data Access Systems. An overview of the features will help to understand that data analysis devices are not anymore the limiting factor in deep packet inspection of a huge amount of traffic. Examples will show what already has been set up and what is possible by companies and organizations \u2013 and which traffic they might monitor yet.\n\nDuring the last three years the speaker installed those appliances from different vendors at customers across Europe, gained deep knowledge of their usage, established a strong contact to the technicians and chief officers both at the vendors and customers side, and found out a lot about the hardware and software by reverse engineering.","persons":{"person":"Lars Weiler"},"links":{"0":"\n        "}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4097"},"start":"18:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 3","slug":"identifizierung_von_netzwerkprotokollen","title":"Techniken zur Identifizierung von Netzwerk-Protokollen","subtitle":{},"track":"Science","type":"lecture","language":{},"abstract":"Der Vortrag soll Techniken aufzeigen, mit denen man Netzwerk-Protokolle identifizieren kann, die in Layer 7 des OSI-Modells angesiedelt sind.

This includes mechanisms for \u201canonymous\u201d communications, censorship resistance, selective disclosure credentials, as well as privacy in databases - all of which are meant to shield the user from some aspects of on-line surveillance. Beyond the lab, some of those systems have been deployed and are widely used today. \n\nYet, the type of surveillance against which privacy technologies are supposed to offer protection is often ill-de\ufb01ned, and widely varying between works: from an individual who wishes \u201cto hide an occasional purchase from his spouse\u201d, to \u201cgroups coordinating political dissent under totalitarian regimes\u201d.

At its heart our argument is that the \ufb01eld of privacy technology was seeded by computer security and cryptography experts that rushed to apply their tools to new problems, yielding mixed results. Additional pressures from different stakeholders to devise technology that will make large IT systems acceptable to the public has led to further confusion about the goals and methods most appropriate to embed privacy friendly values into computer systems. Further, the recent trend has been to replace the confidentiality paradigm with what can be called the \"control\" paradigm. Using concrete examples, we seek to explain why some paradigms came to dominate the \ufb01eld, their advantages, but  also their blind spots, and unfulfilled promises.","persons":{"0":"\n        "},"links":{"0":"\n        "}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4046"},"start":"13:00","duration":"00:30","room":"Saal 2","slug":"all_colours_are_beautiful","title":"AllColoursAreBeautiful","subtitle":"interactive light installation inspired by blinkenlights","track":"Community","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Starting in the beginning of August 2010 and lasting until the end of October, the project AllColoursAreBeautiful by the Munich chapter of the Chaos Computer Club was serving as a platform for interested people on the world to illuminate, animate and interact with the front of a vacant department store in Munich.","description":"The windows were illuminated by remotely controllable, networked RGB LEDs in order to play colorful animations on the facade.

They are laying the foundation of a European police state, since INDECT's results serve to increase the effectiveness of police operation on the national and European level.\nINDECT is funded under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the security-related research of which provides \u20ac 1.4 billion Euro for more than 60 partly interlaced projects.\n\nThis Is What the Police Will Work with in the Future:\n\n\u00b7\tUnmanned aerial vehicles\/drones with surveillance camera and sensors\n\u00b7\tSoftware (for cameras etc.) to identify supposedly suspicious behavior or hostile intent\n\u00b7\tAuto-tracking of mobile objects\n\u00b7\tSoftware (autonomous agents) to monitor virtual spaces such as discussion forums in the Internet or social networks\n\u00b7\tTrojan horses which record users\u2019 private computer activity\n\u00b7\tSafeguards, such as watermarking, to allow sophisticated controls on recorded images for evidence, and to index, analyse and administer multimedia content (such as video)\nA search engine combining direct search of data from the real and the virtual world\n\nThe EU's Current Security Policy\n\nThe recent law on Europol provides the legal framework for the effective use of technology developed in the INDECT-project. It foresees the possibility of passing on police information to undefined and very likely unaccountable bodies in third countries. Parliamentary control by the European Parliament as planned is insufficient.\nINDECT-technology provides inward protection for the Fortress Europe. It supplements, enhances and connects central databases like the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the VISA Information System (VIS). It thus provides technical and organizational support for FRONTEX, the EU border management agency which watches the European Union's borders and bars the access for human beings by questionable means.\n\nDoes the Project Comply with Legality Principles?\n\nFrom the point of view of data and privacy protection, INDECT is unhelpful to say the least: Data is collected without the data subjects' knowledge and without purpose limitations, and mass surveillance is carried out of people who are no danger.\nINDECT also develops autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which up to now are forbidden in most of the member states. How long will it take until laws are modified to permit UAV deployment?\nStakeholders usually have no knowledge of the surveillance and can be denied access to their data with questionable arguments.\n\nEthically Clean - Censorship in Disguise?\n\nThere is an Ethics Board for INDECT. It is chaired by the Assistant Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, Drew Harris. He is supervised by his assistant - of all people. The composition of the ethics board is quite interesting anyhow, and any result emerging from this project has to receive its members' blessing before publication. The board can thus censor these publications, which may contradict the freedom of participating universities of education  and to do research.\nIt is the officially declared purpose of the ethics board to make sure that the project is carried out in accordance with legal standards. However, posterior usage of the research results is of no concern to the board. Technology assessment is not an option, nowhere in this project.\nSo we'd better start doing some right here and now.\n\nCritical Assessment of INDECT-Research\n\nThere is a model for automatically recognizing abnormal behavior and violence. It is based exclusively on interviews with approximately 200 Polish policemen who were questioned about what they consider suspicious behavior. It is therefore not empirical findings on the causes of criminal action that were used for the model, but rather it is prejudice with possibly discriminating effects.\nThese discriminating effects may well add up to self-fulfilling prophecies if the persons they refer to are actually controlled more often and thus become conspicuous.\nReal problems will arise once research leaves the pilot project's framework and its technologies are actually applied.\nThis surveillance technology can also be used outside the EU - in totalitarian regimes. There is no real interest of participating firms to support an export prohibition. The intimidating effect itself, however, is extremely dangerous for democratic societies. It can easily cause changes in the way citizens act, and sooner or later lead to an overly submissive society. Information and political resistance are needed to prevent these consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","persons":{"person":"Sylvia Johnigk"},"links":{"0":"\n        "}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4085"},"start":"20:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 2","slug":"digitale_spaltung_per_gesetz","title":"Digitale Spaltung per Gesetz","subtitle":"Das Internet und geschaffene soziale Ungleichheit im Alltag von Erwerbslosen","track":"Society","type":"lecture","language":{},"abstract":"Hartz IV-Empfangende brauchen keine internetf\u00e4higen Computer, weil sie Fernseher haben.

Although not yet formally defined as\nsuch, it is these ideas and insights that drive the great\ncontributions that hacking has been making to our understanding of\ncomputing, including the challenges of handling complexity,\ncomposition, and security in complex systems. I will argue that\nhacking uncovers and helps to understand (and teach) fundamental\nissues that go to the heart of Computer Science as we know it, and\nwill try to formulate several such fundamental principles which I have\nlearned from hacker research.\n","description":"At some point I relaized that I was learning more about what really\nmatters in computer science from hacker conventions, Phrack,\nUninformed, and other hacker sources than from any academic\nsource. Moreover, it wasn't just about exploits and vulnerabilities,\nit was about how systems were really designed, as opposed to how\ndevelopers thought and students were taught they were. Then I realized\nthat the reason for vulnerabilies that kept on giving were quite\ndeeply theoretical and involved, e.g., theory of computation and\ninformation theory. Very little of this was quoted or understood in\nthe academic publications.\n\nIn this talk I will give a retrospective of hacker research that I\nbelieve has priority in developing or rediscovering important\nscientific ideas that define the discipline of information security.\nI will also argue that \"hacking\" has de-facto become a distinct\nengineering discipline with its own special methods and principles.\n\n1. Hackers invented \"cross-layer analysis\" methodology.\n\nHackers deal with trust properties of software, hardware, and\nhuman-computer systems. Other disciplines claim to study these\nproperties, but hacker approach is radically different: while\nothers focus of *layered designs* (like the OSI networkwing model\nor the application-library-system calls-kernel internals-drivers),\nhacking is essentially *cross-layer*.\n\nIn a word, hackers essentially invented security analysis that focuses\non trust assumptions in interactions between layers in multi-layer\ncomposed systems. It is not formalized to academic standards, but it's\nthere and it delivers.\n\nIn retrospect, the emergence of an engineering discipline that analyzed\nthe trust effects of the prevaling practical method of developing complex\ncomputer systems -- composing them out of mostly independently developed\nand tested components -- was to be expected. Such analysis was sorely\nneeded and would arise even if these issues were continually ignored by\nthe recognized experts and authorities. As it stands, hacker research\narose to fill this gap.\n\nWhereas for a regular developer the layers below or above are implicitly\ntrusted to behave as specified (or at least as described in\ntutorials), hackers focus on how the layers actually interact, and\nhow data and control actually flow through the layers.\n\nThat is why in-depth rootkits (like Phrack 59:5, palmers@team-teso and\nsimilar) are the best possible reading for understang OS structure. I\nassign it in all my OS-related courses. That is why session hijacking\nthrough packet injection and other \"Black Ops\" a-la Ptacek, Newsham, and\nKaminsky is best for understanding how TCP\/IP stacks work: it shows exactly\nwhat data structures are kept by kernels to present the illusion of a\nsession over stateless IP, and how they are controlled.\n\n2. \"Security is not Composable\"\n\nMany of the best hacks are based on an interplay between composition\nof relatively secure parts resulting in new properties that make the\ncomposed system insecure. To a large extent, Hacking as a research\ndiscipline is a study of this phenomenon (which I will illustrate\nwith examples from networks and systems).\n\nFrom the theory standpoint, for a system that is a composition of\nseveral sufficiently complex parts, there is no general algorithm or\nformal method to deduce properties of the composed system even if\nproperties of parts are known. (This can be reduced to the Halting\nProblem or, equivalently, to Rice's Theorem).\n\nI will give examples of insecure system design based on simple\nassumptions about the compositional properties that cannot actually be\nverified in any algorithmic way -- and, as a result, these systems\nremain badly broken despite efforts to fix them. These systems will\nremain untrustworthy and yielding 0-days because their security is\nbased on an undecidable problem that no amount of programming can\nsolve.\n\nA prime example -- taken to the next level of rigor in a major\nbreak-through by Len Sassaman and Meredith Patterson announced\nthis year -- is the case of X.509 certificates. It depends on the\ncomputations involved in parsing of the certificate signing request\nand the signed certificate by the CA and the browser respectively being\nequivalent (i.e., yielding the same result). However, the design of\nthe X.509 protocol makes it computationally impossible to check this\nequivalence -- and so the certificate system will keep on giving.\nMostly likely, there is no \"good enough\" solution, unless a well-defined\nintermediary class of data structures involved is defined.\n\nAnother example of the same thing is NIDS traffic re-assembly.  The\nefficacy of NIDS depends on the re-assembly computation giving the\nsame result on the NIDS and the target -- and this is, in general,\nalso computationally impossible (undecidable), with no \"good enough\"\nsolution either.\n\n3. Hackers re-define what \"computation\" means.\n\nTheory of computation concerns itself with proving what computing\nenvironments can and cannot do -- e.g., that regular expressions\ncannot parse recursive structures (not that it is not being attempted,\nthe last high-profile example being IE's regexp-based anti-XSS rewriting\nfeature which gave rise to a whole new kind of exploits precisely\nbecause of this inability).\n\nDesigners and developers base security of their systems on similar\ntrust assumptions of what the systems can and cannot do. The problem\nis, they do not understand what computations their systems are *actually*\ncapable of.\n\nFrom the early days of Aleph1 stack-smashing, hacking has a great\nhistory of exposing extra computational power in systems, and in\ndemonstrating \"weird\" computations that were thought to be impossible.\nHackers have been exposing unexpected \"weird machines\" actually\ncontained in traditional computing environments, which supported\nunexpected programming models, with exploits as their \"programs\".\n\nExploit development as a discipline is about recognising a \"weird\nmachine\" inherent in the target (which is usually Turing-complete or\nclose) and writing code for it (in its \"weird\" instruction set, which\nmay include calls to library functions, system calls, or just\nreachable pieces code from app to firmware).\n\nIt's all about programming \"platforms within platforms within platforms\".\n\nA prime example is the story of developing the \"return-to-known code\"\nidea, from the original \"return-to-libc\" exploits first published by\nSolar Designer in 1997, through the detailed technique explanation in\nPhrack 2000--2001 (58:4, 59:5), to the recent fully featured compiler\nfor kernel rootkits by Hund, Holz, and Freiling. The idea of such\ncompilers, however, has been circulated in the hacker community\nsince at least 2001, as I will show.\n\nIt took about 10 years for academia to recognize the power of this idea,\nwhich got named \"Return-oriented Programming\" or \"ROP\" in 2008.\n\nThe idea that an exploit -- that is, an actual program in its own\nright, executing on a \"weird machine\" -- could contain *no* native\nexecutable code, and thus instead of looking for \"malicious code\" one\nhad to watch out for \"malicious computation\" (this term itself coined\nin 2008) -- would have been impossible without hacker research.\n\nIn short, hacker research had re-defined the very idea of computation.\n\n4. DoD \"Orange Book\" ideas re-born in hacker OS hardening patches.\n\nI will show how the classic 1970s ideas about building secure systems,\nsuch as those of the DoD \"Rainbow series\" and Tagged architectures,\nwhile long ignored by the commodity computing vendors like Intel, have\nbeen re-born in hacker hardening patches such as OpenWall, PaX,\ngrsecurity patches, etc., and other creative uses of the x86\nsegmentation system, extra page table entry bits, and split TLB.\n\nI will give a historical perspective of these advances, from OpenWall\nto ShadowWalker and beyond.\n\nI will argue that it was hacker research and hacker proof-of-concepts\nthat finally caused the industry to recognize the value of and\nimplement hardware NX protection and introduce NX-based features like\nDEP into mainstream OS (I am indebted to FX for major parts of this\nargument).\n\n5. The hacker development of the debugger into a Turing-complete\n   environment.\n\nIt is a fact that hackers (and, in particular, vuln dev and RE\ncommunities) have been the leading producer of debuggers ever\nincreasing in power, and have in fact changed the very idea\nof the conventional debugger, by making it into a Turing-complete\nenvironment.\n\nThis research involved a deeper understanding of how to use hardware\ntrapping -- including how to trap complex events such as \"a page that\nhas been recently written to by a user process was used to fetch an\ninstruction from\" (OllyBone).\n\nIt opened new directions for security policy mechanisms, reference\nmonitor design, etc., in both academia and industry (of which I will\ngive examples).\n\n6. Trust relationships as first-class networking objects.\n\nI will describe how hacker research into network deceptions and trust\nrelationship mapping in networks created the methodology and the\nindustry of network security assessment.\n\n","persons":{"person":"Sergey Bratus"},"links":{"0":"\n        "}},{"@attributes":{"id":"4168"},"start":"14:30","duration":"00:30","room":"Saal 2","slug":{},"title":"A framework for automated architecture-independent gadget search CCC edition","subtitle":{},"track":"Hacking","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"We demonstrate that automated, architecture-independent gadget search is possible.

We show\nthat these correlations lead to a key recovery attack on WEP with only\n9,800 encrypted packets (less than 20 seconds), instead of\n24,200 for the best previous attack.\n","persons":{"person":"Martin Vuagnoux"},"links":{"0":"\n        "}}]},{"@attributes":{"name":"Saal 3"},"event":[{"@attributes":{"id":"4212"},"start":"11:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 3","slug":"hackers_view_on_motor_control_and_robotics","title":"A hacker's view on motor control and robotics","subtitle":{},"track":"Make","type":"lecture","language":{},"abstract":"The web is full of exciting tutorials and projects for controlling stepper motors, servos and brushless DC motors -- and they're basically all wrong!!","description":"This talk wants to introduce the hacking community to good motor control from the ground up.

While many security issues have long been addressed\nin standardization, real-world VoIP suffers from incomplete and sometimes\nbroken implementations. SIP home gateways -- which combine a NAT router,\na SIP proxy, and a phone adapter are especially at risk.\n\nThe predominant VoIP protocol SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) has\nbeen designed as an -- almost -- stateless protocol. The network elements\nresponsible for call routing only keep very little and short-lived\nstate. This makes SIP highly scalable and substantially simplifies\nfail-over.\n\nTo achieve this, SIP uses source routing mechanisms extensively.\nDue to its security weaknesses, the network layer protocols have long\nabandoned the idea of source routing, despite its theoretical appeal.\nSome IP source routing attacks and countermeasures can be applied to SIP.\n\nThe talk will discuss\n- how to impersonate somebody else, with seemingly network-asserted identity\n- how to trick a home gateway into sending UDP packets to an arbitrary host and port in a victim's LAN.\n- how to make a victim's home gateway call an arbitrary number (with some effort)\n- how to get material for your off-line password guessing attack\n- what SIP providers do about those issues\n- how SIP passed the IETF's security reviews\n- how home gateway vendors should improve their products to avoid all this mess.\n","persons":{"person":"Wolfgang Beck"},"links":{"0":"\n        "}}]}]}]};
