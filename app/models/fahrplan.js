EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card?s PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network."},{"title":"Fnord-Jahresr&uuml;ckblick 2010","duration":60,"start":1305,"ending":1365,"subtitle":"von Atomausstieg bis Zwangsintegration","slots":4,"track":"Society","color":"moccasin","language":"de","persons":"Felix von Leitner, Frank Rieger","humanstart":"21:45","humanend":"22:45","hourid":"21","humanstartend":"21:45 - 22:45","id":"4298","summary":"Auch dieses Jahr werden wir uns wieder bem&uuml;hen, Euch mit einem R&uuml;ckblick auf die Fnords des Jahres zu unterhalten."},{"title":"Hacker Jeopardy","duration":120,"start":1380,"ending":1500,"subtitle":"Number guessing for geeks","slots":8,"track":"Community","color":"khaki","language":"de","persons":"Ray, Stefan 'Sec' Zehl","humanstart":"23:00","humanend":"01:00","hourid":"23","humanstartend":"23:00 - 01:00","id":"4298","summary":"The Hacker Jeopardy is a quiz show."}],"1":[{"title":"A Critical Overview of 10 years of Privacy Enhancing Technologies","duration":60,"start":690,"ending":750,"subtitle":"","slots":4,"track":"Society","color":"moccasin","language":"en","persons":"seda","humanstart":"11:30","humanend":"12:30","hourid":"11","humanstartend":"11:30 - 12:30","id":"4244","summary":"The objective of the session is to provide a critical overview of &quot;privacy research&quot; within computer science.
